## AI Features & Implementation

### 1. AI-Powered Search (Semantic Search)
**Location**: `backend/src/ai-search/ai-search.service.ts`

**How it works:**
- **Keyword Extraction**: Parses natural language queries like "cheap yoga in Sydney with sauna"
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring system:
  - Name matching (weight: 10)
  - Description matching (weight: 8) 
  - Category matching (weight: 6)
  - Services matching (weight: 4)
  - Location matching (weight: 5)
  - Vibe matching (weight: 4)
  - Price context (cheap/budget/premium detection)
- **Smart Context**: Understands price preferences, service requirements, and location context
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large result sets

**Example Queries:**
- "cheap yoga in Sydney with sauna"
- "high-intensity gyms with personal training"
- "24/7 access gyms under $40"

### 2. Intelligent Chatbot (Knowledge-Based RAG)
**Location**: `backend/src/chat/chat.service.ts`

**Architecture:**
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured fitness knowledge covering:
  - Categories (Gym, Yoga, Pilates, CrossFit, Boxing, etc.)
  - Services (Personal Training, Sauna, 24/7 Access, etc.)
  - Vibes (Performance & Intensity, Calm & Wellness, etc.)
  - General advice (Budget, Beginner, Advanced, Location, Schedule)

**RAG Implementation:**
1. **Retrieval**: Keyword extraction from user messages
2. **Augmentation**: Context from relevant venues in dataset
3. **Generation**: Contextual responses with venue recommendations

**Features:**
- **Contextual Responses**: Different response patterns for greetings, help, categories, services
- **Venue Integration**: Automatically suggests relevant venues based on conversation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates response confidence based on keyword matches
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Generates contextual next questions

### 3. Multi-Algorithm Recommendation Engine
**Location**: `backend/src/recommendations/recommendations.service.ts`

**Algorithms Implemented:**

#### Content-Based Filtering
- **User Profile Matching**: Compares venue attributes with user preferences
- **Weighted Scoring**: 
  - Category preferences (15 points)
  - Service matching (8 points)
  - Feature matching (6 points)
  - Vibe matching (10 points)
  - Price range matching (12 points)

#### Collaborative Filtering (Simulated)
- **User Behavior Patterns**: Simulated based on user types
- **Category Affinity**: Different user types have different category preferences
- **Behavioral Scoring**: 20x multiplier for category affinity

#### Popularity-Based Scoring
- **Rating Analysis**: Uses venue ratings (5x multiplier)
- **Review Simulation**: Simulates review count based on ratings
- **Trending Algorithm**: Pure popularity-based recommendations

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Weighted Combination**: 50% content + 30% collaborative + 20% popularity
- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: Chooses algorithm based on available data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Normalizes scores to 0-1 confidence range

**User Profiles:**
- **Fitness Enthusiast**: Gym, CrossFit, Boxing focus
- **Wellness Seeker**: Yoga, Pilates, spa services
- **Budget Conscious**: Affordable options, basic equipment
- **Tech Savvy**: Modern facilities, wearable integration

### 4. Natural Language Processing
**Frontend Implementation**: `frontend/app/page.tsx` (parseNaturalLanguageQuery)

**Capabilities:**
- **Category Detection**: Extracts workout types from queries
- **Location Parsing**: Identifies cities and suburbs
- **Service Requirements**: Detects specific amenities needed
- **Price Preferences**: Understands budget constraints
- **Vibe Matching**: Identifies atmosphere preferences
